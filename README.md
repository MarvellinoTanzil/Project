# Project
This is a basic calculator program developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The calculator provides a graphical user interface for performing arithmetic calculations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculations, and more.

Getting Started
To run the calculator, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script (e.g., calculator.py) and execute it.python calculator.py.The calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform calculations through a user-friendly interface.

Features
Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
Percentage calculation with the "%"" button.
Support for parentheses to handle complex expressions.
Decimal point (.) for floating-point numbers.
Clear button (C) to reset the input field.
Error handling for invalid expressions.
Dependencies
This program uses the Tkinter library, which is included with most standard Python installations. No additional dependencies are required.

Usage
Enter numerical values using the number buttons (0-9).
Perform basic arithmetic operations using the respective buttons.
Use parentheses for grouping in expressions.
Click the "=" button to evaluate the entered expression.
The "C" button clears the input field, and the "%" button calculates percentages.
Decimal point (.) facilitates input of floating-point numbers.
Notes
Avoid division by zero, as the program does not handle division by zero errors.
If an error occurs during evaluation, "Error" will be displayed in the result field.
Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or contribute to its improvement. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let us know. Happy calculating!
